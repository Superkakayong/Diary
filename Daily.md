19 Oct 2020. Today I finished the "Subject 1" exam (科目1考试）and got 96 points out of 100. Also, today I got admitted by an development project team called DiagramAR, which is a team led by Prof. Crovella at Boston University and develops AR applications (both iOS and Android) to facilitate the in-campus teaching. So excited! 

21 Oct 2020. Today I did one Hard Leetcode problem and one Easy problem. The easy one was solved 100% independently! I also found that I could make this Daily file be .md format, so that I could use Markdown syntax! Fantastic!
